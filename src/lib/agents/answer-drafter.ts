      3. Use the retrieved information accurately - don't add or modify facts
      4. Be conversational, friendly, and professional
      5. Keep the response concise but complete
      6. If the question is not about Ralph, politely redirect to topics about Ralph
      7. Tone guidance: ${sentimentGuidance[sentiment]}
      8. Consider memory context to personalize the response and avoid repetition
      
      Return:
      - answer: The drafted response (always as Ralph, in first person)
      - usedSources: The sources you actually used in your answer`,
